### Introduction

This project is built to demonstrate how to build Orders Microservices applications using Microprofile. This application provides basic operations of saving and querying orders from a relational database as part of the Orders function of BlueCompute.

- Based on [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).
- Persist order data to a MySQL database.
- Transmit stock to Inventory using RabbitMQ
- OAuth 2.0 protected APIs
- Deployment options for Minikube environment and ICP.

### How it works

Orders Microservice serves 'IBM Cloud Native Reference Architecture' suite, available at
https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes. Though it is a part of a bigger application, Order service is itself an application in turn that persists the data of orders to a MYSQL database.

</p>

### API Endpoints

The Orders Microservice REST APIs are protected by OpenID Connect. These APIs identifies and validates the caller using mp-jwt tokens.

```
GET     /orders/rest/orders 
```

- Returns all orders. The caller of this API must pass a valid OAuth token. The OAuth token is a JWT with the customer ID of the caller encoded in the `user_name` claim. A JSON object array is returned consisting of only orders created by the customer ID

```
GET     /orders/rest/orders/{id}  
```

- Return order by ID. The caller of this API must pass a valid OAuth token. The OAuth token is a JWT with the customer ID of the caller encoded in the `user_name` claim. If the `id` of the order is owned by the customer passed in the `IBM-App-User` header, it is returned as a JSON object in the response; otherwise `HTTP 401` is returned.

```
POST   /orders/rest/orders
```

- Create an order. The caller of this API must pass a valid OAuth token. The OAuth token is a JWT with the customer ID of the caller encoded in the user_name claim. The Order object must be passed as JSON object in the request body with the following format:

```
{
  "itemId": <item id>,
  "count": <number of items in order>,
}
```

On success, `HTTP 201` is returned with the ID of the created order in the `Location` response header.

### Implementation

#### [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)

MicroProfile is an open platform that optimizes the Enterprise Java for microservices architecture. In this application, we are using [**MicroProfile 1.2**](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom). This includes

- MicroProfile 1.0 ([JAX-RS 2.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339), [CDI 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346), and [JSON-P 1.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
- MicroProfile 1.1 (MicroProfile 1.0, [MicroProfile Config 1.0.](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config))
- [MicroProfile Config 1.1](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) (supercedes MicroProfile Config 1.0), [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance), [MicroProfile Health Check 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health), [MicroProfile Metrics 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics), [MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth).

You can make use of this feature by including this dependency in Maven.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
<artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
<version>1.2</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

You should also include a feature in [server.xml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-orders/blob/microprofile/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml).

```
<server description="Sample Liberty server">

  <featureManager>
      <feature>microprofile-1.2</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <httpEndpoint httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}"
      id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />

</server>
```
### Features

1. Java SE 8 - Used Java Programming language

2. CDI 1.2 - Used CDI for typesafe dependency injection

3. JAX-RS 2.0.1 - JAX-RS is used for providing both standard client and server APIs for RESTful communication by MicroProfile applications.

4. Eclipse MicroProfile Config 1.1 - Configuration data comes from different sources like system properties, system environment variables, .properties etc. These values may change dynamically. Using this feature, helps us to pick up configured values immediately after they got changed.

    The config values are sorted according to their ordinal. We can override the lower importance values from outside. The config sources by default, below is the order of importance.

    - System.getProperties()
    - System.getenv()
    - all META-INF/microprofile-config.properties files on the ClassPath.

    In our sample application, we obtained the configuration programatically.

5. MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0 - Used Microprofile JWT Authentication for token based authentication. It uses OpenIDConnect based JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for role based access control of rest endpoints. This allows the system to verify, authorize and authenticate the user based the security token.

6. MicroProfile Health Check 1.0 - For MicroProfile implementations, this feature helps us to determine the status of the service as well as its availability. This helps us to know if the service is healthy. If not, we can know the reasons behind the termination or shutdown. 

    In our sample application, we injected this `/health` endpoint in our liveness probes.

7. MicroProfile OpenAPI 1.0 - This feature helps us to expose the API documentation for the RESTful services. It allows the developers to produce OpenAPI v3 documents for their JAX-RS applications.

    In our sample application we used @OpenAPIDefinition, @Info, @Contact, @License, @APIResponses, @APIResponse, @Content, @Schema and @Operation annotations.

### Building the app

To build the application, we used maven build. Maven is a project management tool that is based on the Project Object Model (POM). Typically, people use Maven for project builds, dependencies, and documentation. Maven simplifies the project build. In this task, you use Maven to build the project.

1. Clone this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-orders.git`
   
2. `cd refarch-cloudnative-micro-orders/`

3. Checkout MicroProfile branch.

   `git checkout microprofile`

4. Run this command. This command builds the project and installs it.

   `mvn install`
   
   If this runs successfully, you will be able to see the below messages.
   
```

### Setting up MYSQL

#### MYSQL Pre-requisites

1. Set Up MYSQL on Minikube

To set up MYSQL locally on your laptop on a Kubernetes-based environment such as Minikube (which is meant to be a small development environment), we first need to get few tools installed:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) (Kubernetes CLI) - Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to install it on your platform.
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Kubernetes package manager) - Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) to install it on your platform.

Finally, we must create a Kubernetes Cluster. As already said before, we are going to use Minikube:

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) - Create a single node virtual cluster on your workstation. Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) to get Minikube installed on your workstation.

We not only recommend to complete the three Minikube installation steps on the link above but also read the [Running Kubernetes Locally via Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) page for getting more familiar with Minikube.

2. Set Up MYSQL on IBM Cloud Private

To set up MYSQL on IBM Cloud Private, you need to have the following.

[IBM Cloud Private Cluster](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

Create a Kubernetes cluster in an on-premise datacenter. The community edition (IBM Cloud private-ce) is free of charge.
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html) to install IBM Cloud private-ce.

[IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

IBM Private Cloud has all the advantages of public cloud but is dedicated to single organization. You can have your own security requirements and customize the environment as well. Basically it has tight security and gives you more control along with scalability and easy to deploy options. You can run it externally or behind the firewall of your organization.

Basically this is an on-premise platform.

Includes docker container manager
Kubernetes based container orchestrator
Graphical user interface
You can find the detailed installation instructions for IBM Cloud Private [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html)

orders-deployment                           1         1         1            0           1s
```
Please wait till your deployment is ready. To verify run the below command and you should see the availability.

`kubectl get deployments`

You will see something like below.

```
==> v1beta1/Deployment
NAME                                        DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
orders-deployment                           1         1         1            1           1m     
```
**NOTE**: If you are using a version of ICP older than 2.1.0.2, you don't need to add the --tls at the end of the helm command.
